Requirement:
- Two player take turns
- In the same state, the action both players can take are the same
- Game must end in finite turn
- Lose if one player can not move in his/her turn

Solution:
- Using SG value to represent a game
- SG value of multiple game are the xor of all of them
- SG value = 0 iff first move lose. Vice versa.

Find SG value of each game:
- 0 when no move can be taken in the game
- Find the smallest non negative integer that is not belong to
    "All the SG value after one move"
